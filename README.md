A Dart library that implements [Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing) 
over [GF(256)](https://web.archive.org/web/20200210045659/http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~wagner/laws/FFM.html).

Given a secret in bytes, this package can assist in splitting up the secret into `n` parts and would be able to 
reconstruct the secret in bytes given a `t` threshold.

I would highly recommend you look at the the wikipedia page above to learn about the workings of Shamir's Secret Sharing
Scheme.

## Getting Started

To use `dart_ssss`, add it to your dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`:

```
dependencies:
    dart_ssss: any
```

Then import the proper package:

```
import 'package:dart_ssss/dart_ssss.dart';
```


## Usage 

To generate shares / parts for a secret of bytes:

```
void main() {
    
    List<int> secretInByteValues = [...];
    
    SecretScheme ss = new SecretScheme(numberOfPartsToGenerate, thresholdForJoining);
    
    Map<int, List<int>> shares = ss.createShares(secretInByteValues);
    
    ...
      
     
```

To combine shares to regenerate a secret:

```
    List<int> recombinedSecretInBytes = ss.combineShares(shares);
}
```

## Tests

To run tests on this package:

```
    pub run test 
```

in the package directory.


## Limitations / Caveats

Given that the package is implemented over GF(256), it means that the max number of shares / parts it can generate is 
`255`. With that said, it is not advisable to generate `255` shares / parts as an adversary can 
[forge a secret](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/54578/how-to-forge-a-shamir-secret-share).    

Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme does not guarantee integrity, so if you are looking for something where you can verify
shares or the resulting secret, this package is not for you.
